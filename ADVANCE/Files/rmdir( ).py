# Syntax for rmdir( ):

# Here is the program for "mkdir( )".

import os

# making the directory Named NewDir.

os.rmdir( "NewDir" )

print ( "\nNewDir is deleted successfully by using the rmdir( )..." )

# Note : Since i have compiled the code , it deleted the NewDir . So it will not present in my repository.
