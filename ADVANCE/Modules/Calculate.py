# lets see about "Modules" in python.

# Module is python is defined as a python programming file which inculdes python variables, classes etc.

# Modules are used to organize the python code in a logical way.

# To use one Module into other , then the specific module must be imported.

# To use the user defined module , then it is must to create the module which want to be used.

# NOTE : While importing module , by default python create a local directory for that specific module.

# Here is the program "Calculate.py" which is used as a module in other programs.

# Addtion of two values.

def Add( a, b ):

    print("\nAddition of \"a\" and \"b\" is : " , a + b )

# Subtraction of two values.
 
def Sub( a, b ):

    print("\nSubtraction of \"a\" by \"b\" is : " , a - b )

# Multiplication of two values.

def Multi( a, b ):

    print("\nMultiplication of \"a\" and \"b\" is : " , a * b )

# Division of one value by other

def Divide( a, b ):

    print("\nDivision of \"a\" by \"b\" is : " , a / b )
