# In this lets see about the "Built-in functions" in python.

# Built-in function is defined as the functions whose functionality is pre-defined in the python compiler.

# Lets see about "reversed( ) bilt-in function" in python.

# reversed( ) - Used to returns the reversed iterator of the given sequence.
