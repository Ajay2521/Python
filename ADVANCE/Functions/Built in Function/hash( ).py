# In this lets see about the "Built-in functions" in python.

# Built-in function is defined as the functions whose functionality is pre-defined in the python compiler.

# Lets see about "hash( ) bilt-in function" in python.

# hash( ) - Used to return the hash value of an object.

# This hash( ) use the hash algorithm.

# Note : Only certain datatype can be hashed using hash( ) they are * bool * int * long * float * string * Unicode * tuple * code object.

# Here is the program for hash( ).

print( ) # prints new line for readability.

print( hash( 10 ) ) # integer datatype.

print( ) # prints new line for readability.

print( hash( 10.4567 ) ) # float datatype.

print( ) # prints new line for readability.

print( hash( "Maayon" ) ) # String datatype.
