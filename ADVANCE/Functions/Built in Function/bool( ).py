# In this lets see about the "Built-in functions" in python.

# Built-in function is defined as the functions whose functionality is pre-defined in the python compiler.

# Lets see about "bool( ) bilt-in function" in python.

# bool( ) - Used to converts a value to boolean such as True or False using the standard truth testing procedure.

# Here is the program for bool( )

a = [ ]

print ( ) # Prints new line for readability.

print ( a , " is : " , bool( a ) )

a = [ 0 ]

print ( ) # Prints new line for readability.

print ( a , " is : " , bool( a ) )

a = [ 1 ]

print ( ) # Prints new line for readability.

print ( a , " is : " , bool( a ) )

a = 0

print ( ) # Prints new line for readability.

print ( a , " is : " , bool( a ) )

a = 1

print ( ) # Prints new line for readability.
