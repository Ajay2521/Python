# In this lets see about the "Built-in functions" in python.

# Built-in function is defined as the functions whose functionality is pre-defined in the python compiler.

# Lets see about "complex( ) bilt-in function" in python.

# complex( ) - Used to convert a number into a complex datatype.

# complex ( ) gets two parameters and returns a complex number.

# The first parameter passed is called "real number of the complex."

# The Second parameter passed is called "imaginary part of the complex."

# Here is the program for complex( ).

print( ) # print new line for reabability.

print( complex( 10 ) ) # passing only one parameter to the complex( )

print( ) # print new line for reabability.

print( complex( 10 , 20 ) ) # passing two parameter to the complex( )
