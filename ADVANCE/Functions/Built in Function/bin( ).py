# In this lets see about the "Built-in functions" in python.

# Built-in function is defined as the functions whose functionality is pre-defined in the python compiler.

# Lets see about "bin( ) bilt-in function" in python.

# bin( ) - Used to return the binary representation of a specified integer.

# A result always starts with the prefix "0b".

# Here is the program for bin( )

a = 2

print ( "\nThe Binary representation of value \"2\" is : " , bin ( a ) )

a = 4

print ( "\nThe Binary representation of value \"4\" is : " , bin ( a ) )

a = 10

print ( "\nThe Binary representation of value \"10\" is : " , bin ( a ) )
