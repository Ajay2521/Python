# In this lets see about the "Built-in functions" in python.

# Built-in function is defined as the functions whose functionality is pre-defined in the python compiler.

# Lets see about "divmod( ) bilt-in function" in python.

# divmod( ) - Used to return remainder and quotient of two numbers.

# This function takes two numeric arguments and returns a tuple.

# Note : In the ouput tuple the first data is consider as quotient and second data is consider as an remainder.

# Here is the program for divmod( ).

print( )

print( divmod( 21 , 2 ) )
