# In this lets see more about "String Datatype" in Python.

# String datatype in Python is defined as the "collection of characters which are present inside single quotes ( ' ' ) or double quotes ( " " ) or triple quotes ( """ """ or ''' ''') " .

# Since computer does not understand the characters , therefore each and every characters are converted into 0's and 1's.

# This process of converting characters into 0's and 1's are done by considering the standard encoding method in ASCII or Unicode.

# Strings in python is also called as "Collection of Unicode Characters." 

# Here is the program for Strings in Python.

Name = 'Maayon' #String inside single quotes.

print( "\nThe Value present inside the Single quotes ( ' ' ) is : " , Name )

Name = "Maayon" #String inside double quotes.

print( "\nThe Value present inside the Double quotes ( \" \" ) is : " , Name )

Name = '''Maayon''' #String inside triple quotes.

print( "\nThe Value present inside the Triple quotes ( ''' ''' ) is : " , Name )

Name = """Maayon""" #String inside triple quotes.

print( "\nThe Value present inside the Triple quotes ( \"\"\" \"\"\" ) is : " , Name )
