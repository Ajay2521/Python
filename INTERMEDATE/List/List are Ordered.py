# In this lets see more about "List Datatype" in Python.

# A list in Python is used to store the sequence of various types of data.

# The items in the list are separated with the comma ( , ) and enclosed with the square brackets [ ].

# Characteristics of List are as follow :

# 1) List are "Ordered".

# 2) Elements of the list can be accessed by using "Index" as same as String.

# 3) List are "Mutable".

# 4) List can able to store various data elements.

# Here is the Program to understand "List are Ordered one"

# Print True if both the list contains same elements in same order else it print false.

List = [ "Maayon" , 19, "Techgen" ]

List1 = [ 19, "Techgen" , "Maayon" ]

print ( "\nThe value stored in First list is : " , List )

print ( "\nThe value stored in Second list is : " , List1 )

print( "\nIs the Oreder in the \"List\" and \"List1\" are same ? : " , List == List1 ) # Print True if both the list contains same elements in same order else it print false.

# Redefining the List and List1

List = [ "Maayon" , 19, "Techgen" ]

List1 = [ "Maayon" , 19, "Techgen" ]

print ( "\nThe value stored in First list is : " , List )

print ( "\nThe value stored in Second list is : " , List1 )

print( "\nIs the Oreder in the \"List\" and \"List1\" are same ? : " , List == List1 ) # Print True if both the list contains same elements in same order else it print false.
