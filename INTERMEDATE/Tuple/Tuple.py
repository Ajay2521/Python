# In this lets see more about "Tuple datatype" in pyhton.

# Tuple is used to store the sequence of immutable Python objects.

# The tuple is similar to lists.

# The value of "List" can be changed and whereas in the case of "Tuple" the calue is unchanged.

# A tuple can be written as the collection of comma-separated (,) values enclosed with the small ( ) brackets.

# The parentheses are optional but it is good practice to use.

# Here is the Program to understand "Tuple"

Tuple = ( "Maayon" , 19, "Techgen" )

Tuple1 =  19, "Techgen" , "Maayon" 

print ( "\nThe value stored in First tuple is : " , Tuple )
