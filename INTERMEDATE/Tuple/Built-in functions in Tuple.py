# In this lets see about "Built-in functions for Tuple" in Python

# Majorly used Built in functions in Tuple is :

# 1) cmp ( Tuple_variable_1 , Tuple_variable_2 ) - used to compare two variables of Tuple datatype.

# 2) len ( Tuple_variable ) - used to find the length of the Tuple.

# 3) max ( Tuple_variable ) - used to find the maximum value in the Tuple.

# 4) min ( Tuple_variable ) - used to find the minimum value in the Tuple.

# 3) Tuple ( seq ) - used to converts any sequence to the Tuple.

#Note - cmp() is no more in use after the version of python 3 and above

# Here is the program for all Built in functions.

Tuple = ( 30, 40, 50, 10, 20 )

print ( "\nThe Length of the Tuple is : " , len ( Tuple ) ) 

print ( "\nThe Maximum Value of the Tuple is : " , max ( Tuple ) ) 

print ( "\nThe Minimum Value of the Tuple is : " , min ( Tuple ) )
