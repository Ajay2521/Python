#### What is Python Programming ? 

- Python is a Simple , high level and Object Oriented programming language which is created by **Guido Van Rossum**

- Python is also know as **Interpreted scripting language** , which is python code can be executed with or without compiling the Source code or the Python Script . That is python interpreter allows to execute the python code directly.

#### Why Python Programming?

- Python is famously known for its simplicity which is the code which is written in Python is less when compared to other programming languages like C, C++, java etc..,,,

- Python is Simple to learn and effective to use.

- Python support Dynamic Variable allocation , thus there is no need to use data types to declare the varible.

#### Python Versions

- Python consists of2 versions which is Python 2 and Python3 and this 2 versions differ a lot from each other.
- Example Python2 use print as print"Statement", where as Python3 use print as print("Statment").


#### Python Feature:

- Easy and simple to learn.

- Understandable and Readable.

- Interpreted Language.

- Supports in many platform.

- Free and Open Source.

- Object-Oriented Language(OOPs).

- Contains Large Standard Library.

- Supports GUI Programming.

#### Area of Application:

- Web Application.

- Desktop GUI Application.

- Software Development.

- Scientific and Numeric.

- Business Application.

- Console Based Application.

- Audio or Video based Application.

- Enterprise Application.

#### Install Python in Your Local Machine.

[Click Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download Python based on different Operating System and based on 32bit or 64bit.

[Click Here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python-3.8.3.exe) - To download latest version of Python for Windows Operating System with 64bit.   

[Click Here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python-3.8.3-macosx10.9.pkg) - To download latest version of Python for Mac Operating System with 64 bit.

After downloading it , Install it like how we install other application.

After Installation of Python , To check its installation open comand prompt and enter **Python --version** to check the version of python installed in the machine.

#### Lets start

Python support interpreted type which is used to executed python code in interpreter(terminal).

But here i am using Scripting to compile the Python code and Execute the Python code which has compiled.

To compile and execute the python script file.

- First open any text editor like Notepad, Notepad++ etc...,,

- Here i am using Sublime Text editor.

- Then write the python code and save the file by using **.py** extension. 

- Then open comand prompt and specify the file / folder location where the **.py** python file has been saved.

- To compile that **.py** python file type **"python filename.py"** and press Enter.

- If no error then respective output will be displayed on  the screen.

### Important Notes to Learner :

- Anything which is followed by hashtag(#) is consider as a comments. Comments play major role in this tutorial since Comments will be used to explain the syntax and how the program and program control flow in Python Program.

- Follow this README file to make this  tutorial in effective way

- This python tutorial is divided as BASIC , INTERMEDIATE , ADVANCE  


### Before moving directly to the code , follow this README file pattern to make this python tutorial usefull.
