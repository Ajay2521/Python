# In this lets see more about "List Datatype" in Python.

# A list in Python is used to store the sequence of various types of data.

# Lists in Python are mutable. 

# That is it can modify its element after it created.

# The most common and reliable datatype to store the sequences is "List".

# List can be defined as a collection of values or items of different types.

# The items in the list are separated with the comma ( , ) and enclosed with the square brackets [ ].

# Here is the Program to understand "List"

List = [ "Maayon" , 19, "Techgen" ]

List1 = [ 19, "Techgen" , "Maayon" ]

print ( "\nThe value stored in First list is : " , List )

print ( "\nChecking the datatype of the variable \"List1\" : " , type(List) )

print ( "\nThe value stored in Second list is : " , List1 )

print ( "\nChecking the datatype of the variable \"List1\" : " , type(List1) )
