# In this lets see more about "String Datatype" in Python.

# String datatype in Python is defined as the "collection of characters which are present inside single quotes ( ' ' ) or double quotes ( " " ) or triple quotes ( """ """ or ''' ''') " .

# Since computer does not understand the characters , therefore each and every characters are converted into 0's and 1's.

# This process of converting characters into 0's and 1's are done by considering the standard encoding method in ASCII or Unicode.

# Strings in python is also called as "Collection of Unicode Characters." 

# In this lets see about "Slice operator [ ] " in python.

# The slice operator [] is used to access the individual characters of the string.

# : ( colon ) operator in Python is used to access the substring from the given string.

Name = 'Maayon' # String inside single quotes.

print() # Print an empty line for readablity.

print( Name[ : ] ) # Print all the characters.

print() # Print an empty line for readablity.\

print( Name[ 0 : ] ) # Print the characters from [ 0 ] index.

print() # Print an empty line for readablity.\

print( Name[ 2 : ] ) # Print the characters from [ 2 ] index.

print() # Print an empty line for readablity.\

print( Name[ 1 : 5 ] ) # Print the characters from [ 1 ] index to [ 5 ] index.

print() # Print an empty line for readablity.\

print( Name[ : 3 ] ) # Print the characters till [ 3 ] index which is from [ 0 ] index to [ 2 ] index.
