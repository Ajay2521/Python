# Dictionary is an mutable data type.

# The dictionary is defined into element Keys and values.

Details = { } # Empty Dictionary.

print( "\nThe Empty Dictionary Details is...\n\n" , Details )

# Creating dictionary using dict ( )

Details = dict ( { "Name" : "Maayon" , "Age" : 19 } )

print( "\nThe Details in Dictionary created by \"disc ( )\" is...\n\n" , Details )
