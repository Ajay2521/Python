#In this lets see about Number datatype concept in Python Programming.

#The Standard data types in Python Programming is of

#1) Numbers.

#2) String.

#3) List.

#4) Tuple.

#5) Dictionary

#Here we see about "Numbers" in Python

#Number is a standard datatype which is used to store numeric values. 

#Python supports 3 types of numeric data they are

#1) int 

#2) long

#3) complex

#Here is the program for "different numeric data" in Python.

a = 10 #int 

b = 10.12 #float

c = 10 + 10j #complex

#Printing the value of varaible and finding its datatype using type() function.

#Here a special character "\n" has been used which is used to print new line. NO WORRIES , it will be explained in "Escape sequence" chapter.

print("\nThe Value of \"a\" is : " , a , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"a\" is : ", type(a) )

print("\nThe Value of \"b\" is : " , b , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"b\" is : ", type(b) )

print("\nThe Value of \"c\" is : " , c , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"c\" is : ", type(c) )
