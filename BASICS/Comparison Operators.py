#In this "Comparison Operators" concept in Python Program has been explained.

#The operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two operands.

#Operators are the pillars of a program on which the logic is built in any programming language.

#Majorly used Operators are :

#1) Arithmetic Operators

#2) Comparison operators

#3) Assignment Operators

#4) Logical Operators

#5) Bitwise Operators

#6) Membership Operators

#7) Identity Operators

#Lets see about "Comparison Operators" in Python Program.

#Comparison operator is also know as "Relational Operators"

#Majorly used Comparison Operation is :

#1) Equal to ( == )

#2) Not Equal to ( != )

#3) Lesser than or Equal to ( < = )

#4) Greater than or Equal to ( > = )

#5) Lesser than ( < )

#6) Greater than ( > )

#Here is the Python Program for Comparison Operators

#Declaring variable a = 20 and b = 10

a = 20

b = 10

#Here I have used a  concept of if and if-else , Don't worry about it , i will be covering in the if and if else concept later on.

#Now checking for EQUAL TO condition that if "a" and "b" contains an equal or same value then it pass the condition else it will not pass the condition. 

if( a == b ) :

	print("\n\"a\" is Equal to \"b\" and EQUAL TO condition has PASSED.\n" )

else :

	print("\n\"a\" is Not Equal to \"b\" and EQUAL TO condition has FAILED.\n" )

#Now checking for NOT EQUAL TO condition that if "a" and "b" contains an non equal or Different value then it pass the condition else it will not pass the condition. 

if( a != b ) :

	print("\n\"a\" is Not Equal to \"b\" and NOT EQUAL TO condition has PASSED.\n" )

else :

	print("\n\"a\" is Equal to \"b\" and NOT EQUAL TO condition has FAILED.\n" )

#Now checking for Lesser than or Equal to condition that if "a" and "b" contains an equal or value of "a" is lesser than "b" then it pass the condition else it will not pass the condition. 

if( a <= b ) :

	print("\n\"a\" is Lesser than or Equal to \"b\" and LESSER THAN or EQUAL TO condition has PASSED.\n" )

else :

	print("\n\"a\" is Not Lesser than or Equal to \"b\" and LESSER THAN or EQUAL TO condition has FAILED.\n" )

#Now checking for Greater than or Equal to condition that if "a" and "b" contains an Equal or Value of "a" is Greater than "b" then it pass the condition else it will not pass the condition. 

if( a >= b ) :

	print("\n\"a\" is Greater than or Equal to \"b\" and GREATER THAN or EQUAL TO condition has PASSED.\n" )

else :

	print("\n\"a\" is Not Greater than or Equal to \"b\" and GREATER THAN or EQUAL TO condition has FAILED.\n" )

#Now checking for Lesser than condition that if Value of "a" is Lesser than "b" then it pass the condition else it will not pass the condition. 

if( a < b ) :

	print("\n\"a\" is Lesser than \"b\" and LESSER THAN condition has PASSED.\n" )

else :

	print("\n\"a\" is Not Lesser than \"b\" and LESSER THAN condition has FAILED.\n" )

#Now checking for Greater than condition that if Value of "a" is Greater than "b" then it pass the condition else it will not pass the condition. 

if( a > b ) :

	print("\n\"a\" is Greater than \"b\" and GREATER THAN condition has PASSED.\n" )

else :

	print("\n\"a\" is Not Greater than \"b\" and GREATER THAN condition has FAILED.\n" )
