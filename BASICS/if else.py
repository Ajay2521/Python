#In this program lets see about "Decision Making Statements " in Python Programming.

#Descion making statement is used to check for the condition and makes a flow in the program.

#There are 4 types of Decision Making Statement . They are :

#1) if

#2) if else

#3) if elif

#4) Nested if

#In this program lets see about "if else Statement" in Python

#if else statement is an Decision Making Statement which is used to check for Condition.

#If the condition is true , then the code inside if block will be executed.

#else If the condition is false , then the code inside else block will be executed.

#Syntax for "if else statement" is

#if( Conditional Expression ) :

#	Statement 1

#	Statement 2

#	Statement N

#else :

#	Statement 1

#	Statement 2

#	Statement N

#Note : Since Python doesn't denote curly braces . Therefore "indentation" will play an imporatant role is makeing a block of code.

#Thus general four space or tab press is used to mention the indention in the program.

#Program for if else statement

#Declaring Variable a = 10

a = 10

if ( a > 10 ) :

	print("\nFirst if Block is executed when a = 10, where \"a\" is Greater than 10.")

else :

	print("\nFirst else block is executed when a = 10, where \"a\" is Not Greater than 10.")

#Redeclaring Variable a = 20

a = 20

if ( a > 10 ) :

	print("\nSecond if Block is executed when a = 20, where \"a\" is Greater than 10.")

else :

	print("\nSecond else block is executed when a = 20, where \"a\" is Not Greater than 10.")
