#In this program lets see about "Loop" concept in Python.

#Loops are the once which is used to repeat certain code for certain number of times.

#Thus loops will be executed for number of times or till the condition gets fails.

#ADVANTAGES of LOOPS:

#1) Loop is used for code re-usability.

#2) By using loop writing the code again and again can be avoided.

#3) By using loop traversing the element in data structures like array or linked list can be achived.

#There are 3 types of loop they are :

#1) for loop

#2) while loop

#3) do - while loop

#In this lets see about "infinite while loop"

#A while loop which never fails in the condiition is called as infinite while loop

#Which is the loop never ends

#lets see infinite While loop program example :

i = 1

print()

while ( i <= 10 ) : #While loop will be executed until condition becomes false.

	print(i)

#To stop executing the infinite loop "press Ctrl + c ".
