#In this lets see about "String datatype" concept in Python Programming.

#The Standard data types in Python Programming is of

#1) Numbers.

#2) String.

#3) List.

#4) Tuple.

#5) Dictionary

#Lets see about "String Datatype" in Python.

#String is defined as the sequence of characters which is represented in the quotation marks.

#Any character of sequence of characters inside a single quotes ( ' ' ) , double quotes ( " " ) or triple quotes ( """ """ or ''' ''').

#Here is the program for "String Datatype" in Python.

a = 'Single quotes' #single quotes 

b = "Double quotes" #Double quotes

c = """Triple quotes""" #Triple quotes

d = '''Triple quotes''' #Triple quotes

#Printing the value of varaible and finding its datatype using type() function.

#Here a special character "\n" has been used which is used to print new line. NO WORRIES , it will be explained in "Escape sequence" chapter.

print("\nThe Value of \"a\" is : " , a , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"a\" is : ", type(a) )

print("\nThe Value of \"b\" is : " , b , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"b\" is : ", type(b) )

print("\nThe Value of \"c\" is : " , c , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"c\" is : ", type(c) )

print("\nThe Value of \"d\" is : " , d , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"d\" is : ", type(d) )
