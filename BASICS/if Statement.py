#In this program lets see about "Decision Making Statements " in Python Programming.

#Descion making statement is used to check for the condition and makes a flow in the program.

#There are 4 types of Decision Making Statement . They are :

#1) if

#2) if else

#3) if elif

#4) Nested if

#In this program lets see about "if Statement" in Python

#if statement is an Decision Making Statement which is used to check for Condition.

#If the condition is true , then the code inside if statement will be executed.

#If the condition is false , then no action will be taken.

#Syntax for "if statement" is

#if( Conditional Expression):

#	Statement 1

#	Statement 2

#	Statement N

#Note : Since Python doesn't denote curly braces . Therefore "indentation" will play an imporatant role is makeing a block of code.

#Thus general four space or tab press is used to mention the indention in the program.
