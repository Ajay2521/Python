#In this lets see the concept of "Assigning single value to multiple variable" in Python Programming.

#Varaible are used to store the value in a prticular memory location.

#That is variable is a name which is used to refer memory location.

#Variables are also known as "IDENTIFIER".

#In python varaibles are declared only by means of it name rather than by using its datatype and name.

#Since Python compilers are build in such a way that it automatically finds the datatype of the variable and assign it to that variable.

#To assign a value to a variable "equal operator ( = )" has to be used.

#Here is the program for "Assigning single value to multiple variable" .

#declaring and assigning a value to a variable

a = b = c = 10

#Printing the value of varaible and finding its datatype using type() function.

#Here a special character "\n" has been used which is used to print new line. NO WORRIES , it will be explained in "Escape sequence" chapter.

print("\nThe Value of \"a\" is : " , a , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"a\" is : ", type(a) )

print("\nThe Value of \"b\" is : " , b , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"b\" is : ", type(b) )

print("\nThe Value of \"c\" is : " , c , "\nThe Datatype of variable \"c\" is : ", type(c) )
