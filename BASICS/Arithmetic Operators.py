#In this "Arithmetic Operators" concept in Python Program has been explained.

#The operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two operands.

#Operators are the pillars of a program on which the logic is built in any programming language.

#Majorly used Operators are :

#1) Arithmetic Operators

#2) Comparison operators

#3) Assignment Operators

#4) Logical Operators

#5) Bitwise Operators

#6) Membership Operators

#7) Identity Operators

#Lets see about "Arithmetic Operators" in Python Program.

#Majorly used Arithmetic Operators are:

#1) Addition ( + )

#2) Subtraction ( - )

#3) Division ( / )

#4) Multiplication ( * )

#5) Reminder ( % )

#6) Exponent ( ** )

#7) Floor Division ( // )

#Here is the Python Program for Arithmetic Operator.

#Declaring variable a = 20 and b = 10

a = 20

b = 10

#Claculating Addition of two variable "a" and "b".

Sum = a + b

print("\nThe Addition of value " , a ," and " , b , " is : " , Sum )

#Claculating Subtraction of two variable "a" and "b".

Sub = a - b

print("\nThe Subtraction of value " , a ," by " , b , " is : " , Sub )

#Claculating Multiplication of two variable "a" and "b".

Multi = a * b

print("\nThe Multiplication of value " , a ," and " , b , " is : " , Multi )

#Chaning the value of "a"

a = 21
#Claculating Division of variable "a" by "b".

Div = a / b

print("\nThe Division of value " , a ," by " , b , " is : " , Div )

#Claculating Remainder of variable "a" which is divied by "b".

Rem = a % b

print("\nThe Remainder of value " , a ," which is divied by " , b , " is : " , Rem )

#Claculating expoent of a variable "a" by the power of "b".

Exp = a ** b

print("\nThe Expoent of value " , a ," by the power of " , b , " is : " , Exp )

#Claculating Floor value of the quotient of a variable "a" which is divided "b".

FloorDiv = a // b

print("\nThe Floor value  of the quotient of " , a ," which is divided by " , b , " is : " , FloorDiv )
