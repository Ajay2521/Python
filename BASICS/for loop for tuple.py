#In this program lets see about "Loop" concept in Python.

#Loops are the once which is used to repeat certain code for certain number of times.

#Thus loops will be executed for number of times or till the condition gets fails.

#ADVANTAGES of LOOPS:

#1) Loop is used for code re-usability.

#2) By using loop writing the code again and again can be avoided.

#3) By using loop traversing the element in data structures like array or linked list can be achived.

#There are 3 types of loop they are :

#1) for loop

#2) while loop

#3) do - while loop

#In this lets see about "for loop"

#for loop is used to repeat the statement or code for certian number of time.

#for loop is mainly used to traverse the data structures like list , tuple or dictionary.

#synatx for "for loop" is

#for iterating_variable in sequence_variable :

#	statement(s)

#for loop program example for tuple

tuple = ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 )

for i in tuple : # i is the iterating_variable and tuple is the squence 

	print(i)

#Thus this program will be executed for the number time of value present in the tuple
